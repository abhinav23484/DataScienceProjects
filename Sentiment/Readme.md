I am just a beginner in this project. I haven't prepared any documentations for this. I will add it later on. The data for this project is from twitter using twitter API. To get your own API register as twitter developer.
This project gets you previous 100 tweets of Taylor Swift and analyse the sentiment-positive, negative or neutral in each tweet. You can change the person name with any twitter handle of your choice. 
There are different visulizations of the sentiment and word cloud of the data.
To run this you need to install the libraries following way-
#1 In CMD with PIP installed:-
1.pip install tweepy
2.pip install pandas
3.pip install numpy
4.pip install textblob
5.pip install wordcloud
6.pip install matplotlib
#2 open the jupyter notebook and run each block 
#3 Use your twitter api credentials for data. I have left that blank.
